"""Frontier exploration: the part the official simulation does not give us.

The brief asks for "场景探索" (scene exploration), and the organisers ship the
simulator only -- `vehicleSimulator.cpp` subscribes to `/cmd_vel` and moves the
car, but there is no planner anywhere in `src.zip`.  So the robot has to decide
where to go, and this module makes that decision from the map we are already
building.

The rule is the classic one, and it is a good fit here because the map is
literally already in memory:

    a **frontier** is a drivable cell that touches an unseen cell.
    drive to the nearest reachable one.

Three details that make it behave on a real 2D grid rather than in a slide:

  * **reachability is checked, not assumed.**  "Nearest" by straight-line
    distance is regularly behind a wall.  Candidates are ray-marched through the
    occupancy grid and the first one with a clear line wins.
  * **the target is a cluster centroid, not a single cell.**  Chasing one cell
    of a ragged boundary makes the car twitch; the centroid of the cells around
    the chosen one is stable.
  * **forward clearance gates the throttle.**  Turning in place while blocked is
    free; driving into a wall is not.  The speed is zeroed unless the corridor
    straight ahead is clear for `front_stop` metres, which also makes the car
    naturally slow down at corners.

The controller is a plain proportional law -- there is nothing to train here,
and the round-2 marking is about perception and portability, not about the
planner.

class VelocitySender:
    """Publishes the latest twist at a fixed rate on a background thread.

    Why a thread rather than one publish per frame: the loop runs at the LiDAR
    rate (5 Hz in the simulation), and a controller that only updates 5 times a
    second is coarse at the start of a turn.  The publisher also keeps the last
    command alive between frames, which is what a real base expects.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    THREE THINGS THIS CLASS GOT WRONG FIRST, all of which produce the same
    symptom -- the robot sits still and nothing anywhere reports an error:

    1. **The publisher was constructed before `rospy.init_node`.**  The source
       normally initialises the node lazily on its first frame, which happens
       *after* this object is built.  So the publisher had no node to belong
       to.  `start()` now initialises the node itself if nobody has.
    2. **A publisher needs time to connect.**  ROS wires publishers and
       subscribers asynchronously, so messages sent in the first few hundred ms
       go nowhere.  `start()` waits for `get_num_connections()`.
    3. **The thread died silently.**  The first `rospy.Time.now()` raised, the
       daemon thread ended, and the run reported `cmd_published: 0` only in a
       JSON file nobody was reading.  A background worker that can fail must
       publish its own failure -- `self.error` below, surfaced in the summary.
